# Performance Testing for https://automationintesting.online/

## Introduction
Below I have outlined the approach for conducting performance testing on the 'https://automationintesting.online/' website. The objective is to evaluate the performance and scalability of the website under different load conditions.

## Performance Testing Types
Below I have created three performance testing scripts, each representing a different type of performance testing. The chosen tools for scripting and execution are:

1. Load Testing:
   - Tool: Apache JMeter
   - Script: load_test_1
   - Objective: Measure the website's performance under expected load conditions.

2. Stress Testing:
   - Tool: Gatling
   - Script: stress_test_1
   - Objective: Evaluate the website's behavior and performance under high load conditions.

3. Endurance Testing:
   - Tool: Locust
   - Script: endurance_test_1
   - Objective: Assess the website's performance and stability over an extended period of time.

## Test Scenarios
For each performance testing type, I defined specific test scenarios to cover different aspects of the website's performance. These scenarios may include:

1. Load Testing Scenarios:
   - Simulate concurrent user sessions accessing different pages of the website.
   - Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization.

2. Stress Testing Scenarios:
   - Generate a high number of concurrent requests to stress the website's resources.
   - Monitor system metrics and identify performance bottlenecks.

3. Endurance Testing Scenarios:
   - Run a continuous load on the website for an extended duration.
   - Monitor memory usage, CPU utilization, and database performance.

## Test Execution
The performance testing scripts will be executed in a controlled test environment that closely resembles the production environment. The execution process will involve:

1. Test Environment Setup:
   - Provision a dedicated test environment with similar hardware and software configurations as the production environment.
   - Install and configure the necessary tools for performance testing.

2. Test Data Preparation:
   - Identify and generate realistic test data to be used during the performance tests.

3. Test Execution:
   - Execute the performance testing scripts for each type of performance testing.
   - Monitor and collect performance metrics during the test execution.

4. Results Analysis:
   - Analyze the collected performance metrics to identify any performance issues or bottlenecks.
   - Generate performance reports with detailed findings and recommendations.

## Summary
By following this performance testing approach, I aim to gain insights into the performance characteristics of the 'https://automationintesting.online/' website and identify any areas for improvement. The results of the performance tests will help in optimizing the website's performance and ensuring a better user experience.
