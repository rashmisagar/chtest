# Security Scan Approach for https://automationintesting.online/

## Introduction
Below I have outlined the process of running a security scan against https://automationintesting.online/ and the tools that I will use for the scan in identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities. I have also provided an initial inspection of the website to identify any evident security flaws.

## Process
1. **Identify the scope**: This will determine the specific areas of the website that will be included in the security scan. This may include the main website, subdomains, APIs, etc.

2. **Select the scanning tool**: Then I will choose a suitable security scanning tool based on the requirements and the type of vulnerabilities to be tested. Some popular tools include:
   - [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
   - [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)
   - [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)

3. **Configure the scanning tool**: This step will set up the scanning tool with the necessary configurations, such as target URL, authentication credentials (if required), and scan policies.

4. **Perform the scan**: This initiates the security scan using the selected tool. This may involve crawling the website, identifying vulnerabilities, and generating a report.

5. **Analyze the results**: Then I will review the scan results and prioritize the identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.

6. **Remediate the vulnerabilities**: I will then work with the development and security teams to address the identified vulnerabilities. This may involve applying patches, fixing code issues, or implementing security best practices.

7. **Re-scan and validate**: After the remediation, I will perform another security scan to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been successfully mitigated.

## Initial Inspection
The initial inspection of https://automationintesting.online/, will identify the following potential problems:
- Insecure communication: To identify if the website enforces secure connections, HTTPS instead of HTTP, which may expose sensitive user data to potential attackers.
- Lack of input validation: To investigate if the website appears to have user input fields that may be vulnerable to injection attacks.
- Missing security headers: To identify if the website have certain security headers, such as Content Security Policy (CSP) and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which can help protect against various attacks.

Please note that after this initial inspection, a further detailed analysis is required during the security scan.
